    "    b) Spróbuj wykorzystać ColumnTransformer i pipeliny z biblioteki scikit-learn.\n",
    "4) Zaproponuj pierwszy prosty model (koncepcja 'minimum viable product').\n",
    "5) Może powinniśmy wykorzystać regularyzację?\n",
    "6) Spróbuj przetestować kilka modeli (np. logistic regression, decision tree). Wykorzystaj do tego crosswalidację.\n",
    "7) Z przetestowanych modeli wybierz najlepszą klasę modeli.\n",
    "8) Zoptymalizuj hiperparametry wykorzystując RandomSearch/GridSearch oraz crosswalidację.\n",
